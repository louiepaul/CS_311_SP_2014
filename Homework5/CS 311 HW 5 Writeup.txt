CS 311 HW 5 Writeup

I worked on this assignment with a tutor and also discussed concepts and issues with Emma Paul. We also shared links and references that we felt were helpful from the web. The code I wrote is my own, and any similarity may be due to us utilizing the same references. 

I was not able to complete Problem 3 in this assignment in its entirety. Through my working on it, I was able to create however many sub processes were specified, I was able to read and send entire files no matter the size, and I was able to receive and sort those words from the message queues. However, at some point I was unable to combine all of these so I had to cut my losses and simply put together a program that sort of works the way it is supposed to. For example, it works on the declaration of independence, but gets hung up at the end of the Iliad. I understand conceptually why this is, but was never able to implement a solution based on what I was taught or what I was able to find. 
Had I gotten there, my combiner stage would have taken the first word from each message queue (now sorted), placed them in a dynamic array, and then compared them against each other. Whichever one was the smallest would become the temp word. Once we had the smallest, I would have iterated through the array, counting how many times that word showed up, and when they matched, popped it off and replaced that word with the next word in the message queue from that specific message queue (I thought of them kind of like the ball return at a bowling ally or in skeet ball). Once the temp word was not found in the array, I would print it with the count and then find the next word and start all over again. Unfortunately, I never got to a stage where I could try to implement such a thing.
